    "The Python string methods are great for ease of use. If what you're trying to do can be accomplished with string functions, you should use them. They're fast and simple and easy to read, and there's a lot to be said for fast, simple, readable code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, string methods are limited to the simplest of search and replace cases. The search methods look for a single, hard-coded substring, and they are always case-sensitive. To do case-insensitive searches of a string s, you must call s.lower() or s.upper() and make sure your search strings are the appropriate case to match. The replace  methods have the same limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world. Many bioiformatic problems involve using regular expressions and we will spend a lot of time in this class building our knowledge of regular expressions through many use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides regular expression patterns using the RE module.  Moldules in python are simply files consisting of Python code, that are not typically used when a Python program is run.  Later we will use other Python math and science specific modules that have been writting by experts in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different functions of the RE module and a nice HOWTO in the Python Docs-https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#compiling-regular-expressions and also see the manual pages on regular expressions - https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=regular%20expression#. \n",

    "* pattern - This is the regular expression to be matched.\n",
    "* string - This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern anywhere in the string.\n",
